# hugo-eclipsefdn-website-boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to help Eclipse Projects migrate their website to Hugo!

## Getting started

Clone the project with submodules and start a web server:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eclipse-windowbuilder/windowbuilder-website-source.git
cd  windowbuilder-website-source
hugo server
```

### Update hugo-solstice-theme

The [hugo-solstice-theme](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/it/webdev/hugo-solstice-theme) was added to this project as a git submodule.

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

For more information, please see git documentation on [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## How to build my project's website with Jenkins?

The preferred static website generator for Eclipse project websites is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

You should first put your Hugo sources in a dedicated Git repository, either at GitHub if your source code is already hosted at GitHub or at [gitlab.eclipse.org](https://gitlab.eclipse.org). If you don't have such a repository already, feel free to [open a request](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new), the Eclipse IT team will create one for you.

Note that each and every Eclipse project automatically gets a Git repository with `git.eclipse.org/www.eclipse.org/<project_name>` (see this [repository index](https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/www.eclipse.org/) for complete list). This is not where you want to push your Hugo sources. This repository contains the webpages that are automatically and regularly pulled and published on the www.eclipse.org HTTP server. All the content from the master branch will eventually be available at the URL https://www.eclipse.org/<project_name>.

We recommend that our projects start with forking our [hugo-eclipsefdn-website-boilerplate](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/it/webdev/hugo-eclipsefdn-website-boilerplate) project.

After forking this project for your own use, please go to your project's Settings > General > Advanced > Remove fork relationship and remove the fork relation, this  won't be necessary unless you want to contribute back to this project.

Once your Hugo sources are in the proper repository, update the file named `Jenkinsfile` at the root of the repository with the proper value for `PROJECT_NAME` and `PROJECT_BOT_NAME` environment variable. We also expect projects to update the README.md, config.toml and all the files in the content folder.

If you don't have a Jenkins instance already, [ask for one](https://wiki.eclipse.org/CBI#Requesting_a_JIPP_instance). If you need assistance with the process, [open a ticket](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/new).

The `Jenkinsfile` example assumes that your project will use `main` as the default branch for your source code. Projects will need to make changes to the file to use a different branch name.
